* Testing Spookfox

There are no automated tests so far. This setup is for manually testing Spookfox. This directory has
code to set a clean testing environment on Guix.

** Testing with Elpaca

As prompted by #39, here's how I tested the issue:

1. Load latest stable emacs: =cd test; direnv allow=
2. Start Emacs with just spookfox loaded; =emacs --init-dir ./with-elpaca=

   This starts Emacs, installs Elpaca and Spookfox as setup defined in =./with-elpaca/init.el=
3. Change Spookfox branch/repo: Edit =./with-elpaca/init.el= and run =rm -rf
   ./with-elpaca/elpaca/builds/spookfox && rm -rf ./with-elpaca/elpaca/repos/spookfox=, and
   repeat step 2.
